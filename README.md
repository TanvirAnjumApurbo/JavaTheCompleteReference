# ‚òï Java: The Complete Reference
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project is designed to help you learn Java through practical examples and exercises. Each section of the project focuses on a specific area of the Java programming language, starting from basic concepts and gradually moving to more advanced topics. By exploring and experimenting with the code provided in each chapter, you can build a strong foundation in Java programming.

### How This Project Can Help You Learn Java
- **Structured Learning:** The project is organized into chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of Java. This structure allows you to progress through the language systematically, building on what you‚Äôve learned in previous chapters.

- **Hands-On Practice:** By working through the examples and exercises, you'll gain hands-on experience with Java's core features, including data types, operators, control statements, and object-oriented programming.

- **Real-World Applications:** The code examples in this project are designed to illustrate real-world scenarios, helping you understand how Java is used in practical applications.

- **Self-Paced Learning:** You can work through the chapters at your own pace, revisiting concepts as needed to reinforce your understanding.

- **Code Exploration:** The project encourages you to explore and modify the code, allowing you to see the effects of different changes and deepen your understanding of Java.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
### 1. `src/` - Source Code

This directory contains all the main code, organized into chapters:

- **`c01/`**: Chapter 1 - The History and Evolution of Java
- **`c02/`**: Chapter 2 - An Overview of Java
- **`c03/`**: Chapter 3 - Data Types, Variables, and Arrays
- **`c04/`**: Chapter 4 - Operators
- **`c05/`**: Chapter 5 - Control Statements
- **`c06/`**: Chapter 6 - Introducing Classes
- **`c07/`**: Chapter 7 - A Closer Look at Methods and Classes


### 2. `out/` - Compiled Classes

The `out/` directory contains the compiled `.class` files generated from the Java source code. This is where the compiled Java bytecode resides, and it's what the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes when running the programs.
